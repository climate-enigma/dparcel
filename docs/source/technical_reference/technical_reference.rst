Abstract
----------

Downdrafts are known to play an important role in the dynamics of the
Earth's atmosphere and climate, but current quantitative understanding
of the mechanisms that generate, maintain and inhibit them is lacking.
A simple original model, based on the parcel theory that considers
only buoyant forces, is devised to investigate the factors that
determine the speed with which a negatively buoyant air mass descends,
and the distance it is able to penetrate in the atmosphere.
