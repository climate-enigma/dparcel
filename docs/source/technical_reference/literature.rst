Literature review
===================

In their review of existing literature,
[knupp_cotton_1985]_ identify four downdraft types based
on the mechanisms that generate or maintain them, which
informed the methods of this investigation: penetrative, cloud-edge,
overshooting and precipitation-associated.
The penetrative type arises when subsaturated environmental air
is *entrained* (mixed) into saturated cloudy air, allowing
evaporation of the excess liquid that creates negative buoyancy.
The cloud-edge type, they note, is less understood and may result
from evaporative cooling at the edges of clouds.
An overshooting downdraft may be generated when the inertia of
an updraft causes it to rise beyond its level of neutral buoyancy
and subsequently sink.
The precipitation-associated downdraft is generated by the evaporation
of precipitation into subsaturated air beneath a cloud, with the cooling
creating negative buoyancy. They note that 20 m/s
is a typical upper limit on downdraft velocity in all cases. The model
presented in
this work most closely describes the precipitation-assiciated and
penetrative types.

[knupp_cotton_1985]_ find that downdrafts often become
subsaturated during descent, a conclusion reproduced by
[thayer-calder_2013]_ in a Lagrangian (parcel-tracking)
study of the output of a cloud-resolving model. The latter also found
that downdrafts often descend past their neutral buoyancy levels.
These findings are clearly reproduced in this work.

[market_et_al_2017]_ use case studies to investigate the dependence
of downdraft
penetration depth on quantities known as *downdraft convective
available potential energy* (DCAPE) and *downdraft convective
inhibition* (DCIN). The former is a measure of the maximum kinetic
energy per unit mass a parcel in a given environment may gain,
and the latter is a measure of the work necessary to bring the parcel
to the ground once it passes its neutral buoyancy level, against
the upward buoyant force. Both are calculated as integrals of the
buoyant force with respect to height between chosen initial and final
levels (bracketing
regions of positive buoyancy for DCAPE and negative buoyancy for DCIN).
They come to the conclusion that the smaller
the DCIN relative to the DCAPE, the more likely downdrafts are to
penetrate stable parts of the atmosphere and reach the ground.
[sumrall_2020]_ conducts further case study investigations,
with findings supporting a hypothesis that small ratios of
:math:`|\mathrm{DCIN}/\mathrm{DCAPE}|` are correlated with stronger and deeper downdraft
activity and surface winds, and vice versa for large ratios.
This work also reproduces the above findings.
